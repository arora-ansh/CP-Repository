## Adhoc Problems

Majorly inka yahi rehta hai ki you have to find koi recurring pattern in the question that will shorten the question. (Some observation that simplifies the question)
Egs - In the bulb question, we simply had to figure out the best way to get all the bulbs together and that could simply be minimized by (n-1) x min(x,y).
In the team question, we just had to figure out the three different possible switches and then create an iterative loop.

Best practice - 
- Write down test cases on paper and try to figure out a pattern.
- On figuring out the pattern, try to figure out a primary solution for it.
- Try creating different cases and dry running the algo on it.
- Make specific additions if required.
- Try on corner cases.
- Code the problem after that.
